# To Do List

- Clean up the animated borders
  - Confirm that they are large enough to avoid clipping
  - Maybe round them out into circles
  - Possibly change the colours and exclude white
  - Make the animation slower
  - Possibly offset the animations
- Clean up the tools logos
  - Fix the bad colouring in the .NET Core logo and GitHub logo
  - Remove the TM in the Arduino logo
  - Use the simple version of the OpenGL logo
  - Fix the mismatched gradients (likely caused by duplicate IDs)
